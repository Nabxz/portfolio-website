"Developed 'Galaxy,' an immersive web platform integrating real-time NASA and Pixabay data for space exploration, featuring dynamic content, interactive tools, and secure user engagement."

## ðŸš€ API Usage Notice

This project uses several public APIs (e.g., NASA, Ninja, Pixabay) to fetch real-time space, Earth, and media data.

All API keys are **intentionally exposed** because:

- These APIs are **read-only**, public, and designed for safe use in client-side applications.
- No sensitive, private, or user-specific data is accessed.
- This is a **portfolio/demo project** hosted on GitHub Pages, which does **not support server-side environments** or secret management.
- The exposed keys are used solely for **displaying public data** such as weather, planetary info, media, and timezones.

If you fork or deploy this project, youâ€™re free to use your own API keys or proxy them through a backend if needed.
